# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature involves creating a Discord bot using discord.py that provides a comprehensive ticket management system. The bot will allow users to create, manage, and interact with support tickets through Discord channels. The system will support multiple database backends (MongoDB, MySQL, SQLite) and maintain a modular architecture for easy maintenance and extensibility.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a Discord server member, I want to create a new support ticket, so that I can get help with my issues in an organized manner.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user clicks the ticket creation button THEN the system SHALL create a new private channel for the ticket
2. WHEN a ticket is created THEN the system SHALL assign a unique ticket ID to the channel
3. WHEN a ticket channel is created THEN the system SHALL add the ticket creator and designated staff roles to the channel
4. WHEN a ticket is created THEN the system SHALL log the creation event with timestamp and user information
5. IF the user already has an active ticket THEN the system SHALL prevent creation of additional tickets and notify the user

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a server administrator, I want to send a ticket creation embed with a button, so that users can easily initiate the ticket creation process.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an administrator uses the ticket embed command THEN the system SHALL send an embed message with a "Create Ticket" button
2. WHEN the embed is sent THEN the system SHALL include clear instructions on how to use the ticket system
3. WHEN a user clicks the button THEN the system SHALL trigger the ticket creation process
4. IF the embed command is used without proper permissions THEN the system SHALL deny access and notify the user

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a staff member, I want to add other users to existing tickets, so that multiple people can collaborate on resolving issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a staff member uses the add command with a valid user THEN the system SHALL add the specified user to the ticket channel
2. WHEN a user is added to a ticket THEN the system SHALL grant them read and write permissions to the channel
3. WHEN a user is added THEN the system SHALL log the addition event with staff member and added user information
4. IF a non-staff member attempts to add users THEN the system SHALL deny the action and notify them
5. IF the specified user is already in the ticket THEN the system SHALL notify that the user is already present

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a staff member, I want to remove users from tickets, so that I can control access to sensitive ticket information.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a staff member uses the remove command with a valid user THEN the system SHALL remove the specified user from the ticket channel
2. WHEN a user is removed THEN the system SHALL revoke their access permissions to the channel
3. WHEN a user is removed THEN the system SHALL log the removal event with staff member and removed user information
4. IF a non-staff member attempts to remove users THEN the system SHALL deny the action and notify them
5. IF the specified user is not in the ticket THEN the system SHALL notify that the user is not present
6. IF attempting to remove the ticket creator THEN the system SHALL require additional confirmation

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a server administrator, I want to configure multiple database backends, so that I can choose the most suitable storage solution for my server's needs.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the bot is configured THEN the system SHALL support MongoDB as a database backend option
2. WHEN the bot is configured THEN the system SHALL support MySQL as a database backend option  
3. WHEN the bot is configured THEN the system SHALL support SQLite as a database backend option
4. WHEN database operations are performed THEN the system SHALL efficiently load and save data with proper connection pooling
5. WHEN switching between database types THEN the system SHALL maintain data consistency and integrity
6. IF database connection fails THEN the system SHALL implement retry logic and fallback mechanisms

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer maintaining the bot, I want commands organized in separate files, so that the codebase remains modular and maintainable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the bot is structured THEN the system SHALL separate each command into individual files
2. WHEN commands are organized THEN the system SHALL group related functionality into logical modules
3. WHEN new commands are added THEN the system SHALL follow the established modular pattern
4. WHEN the bot loads THEN the system SHALL automatically discover and load all command modules
5. IF a command module fails to load THEN the system SHALL log the error and continue loading other modules

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a staff member, I want to close tickets when issues are resolved, so that the ticket system remains organized and channels don't accumulate unnecessarily.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a staff member closes a ticket THEN the system SHALL archive the ticket channel
2. WHEN a ticket is closed THEN the system SHALL save a transcript of the conversation
3. WHEN a ticket is closed THEN the system SHALL update the database to mark the ticket as resolved
4. WHEN a ticket is closed THEN the system SHALL notify relevant parties of the closure
5. IF a non-staff member attempts to close a ticket THEN the system SHALL deny the action

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a server administrator, I want to configure bot settings and permissions, so that the ticket system integrates properly with my server's structure.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN configuring the bot THEN the system SHALL allow setting of staff roles that can manage tickets
2. WHEN configuring the bot THEN the system SHALL allow setting of ticket category where new channels are created
3. WHEN configuring the bot THEN the system SHALL allow customization of embed messages and button text
4. WHEN permissions are checked THEN the system SHALL verify user roles against configured staff roles
5. IF configuration is invalid THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages and prevent startup
